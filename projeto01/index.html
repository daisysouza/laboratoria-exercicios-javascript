    <h1>Introdução a JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript isn’t the only programming language out there—in
        fact, there are literally hundreds of programming languages.
        But there are many reasons to learn JavaScript. For one, it’s a
        lot easier (and more fun) to learn than many other programming
        languages. But perhaps best of all, in order to write and run
        JavaScript programs, all you need is a web browser like Internet
        Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, or Google Chrome. Every web browser
        comes with a JavaScript interpreter that understands how to read
        JavaScript programs.</p>
